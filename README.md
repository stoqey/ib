`@stoqey/ib` is an <ins>unofficial</ins> [Interactive Brokers](http://interactivebrokers.com/) TWS (or IB Gateway) Typescript API client library for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). It is a direct port of Interactive Brokers' Java Client Version 9.76 from May 08 2019.

Refer to the [Trader Workstation API](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/) for official documentation and the C#/Java/VB/C++/Python client.

The module makes a socket connection to TWS (or IB Gateway) using the [net](http://nodejs.org/api/net.html) module and all messages are entirely processed in Typescript. It uses [EventEmitter](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html) to pass the result back to user.

## Installation

    $ npm install @stoqey/ib
	
## API Documenation

<b>[See API documentation here.](https://stoqey.github.io/ib-doc/)</b>

## Example

```js

/* Example: Print all portfolio posistions to console. */

import { IBApi, EventName, ErrorCode, Contract } from "@stoqey/ib";

// create IBApi object

const ib = new IBApi({
  // clientId: 0,
  // host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 7497,
});

// register event handler

let positionsCount = 0;

ib.on(EventName.error, (err: Error, code: ErrorCode, reqId: number) => {
  console.error(`${err.message} - code: ${code} - reqId: ${id}`);
})
.on(EventName.position, (account: string, contract: Contract, pos: number, avgCost: number) => {
  console.log(`${account}: ${pos} x ${contract.symbol} @ ${avgCost}`);
  positionsCount++:
})
.once(EventName.positionEnd, () => {
  console.log(`Total: ${positionsCount} posistions.`);
  ib.disconnect();
});

// call API functions

ib.connect();
ib.reqPositions();
```

## How to contribute

IB does regularly release new API versions, so this library will need permanent maintenance in oder to stay up-to-date with latest TWS features.<br/>
Also, there is not much testing code yet. Ideally there should be at least one test-case for each public function.<br/>
In addition to that.. a little demo / example app would be nice, to demonstrate API usage (something like a little live-portoflio-viewer app for node.js console?).<br/>
Any kind of bugfixes are welcome as well.

If you want to contribute, read the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/stoqey/ib/wiki/Developer-Guide) and start coding.
